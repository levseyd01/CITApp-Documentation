## Managing Different Accounts

Managing accounts allows you to quickly navigate between the homepages of different accounts. 

To **Manage an Account**:

1. Go to the {my-accounts-category}`My Accounts` page. 

```{lazyfigure} ../_static/solo_app/My_Accounts/my-accounts-main-page-location.jpg
:width: 50%
:name: my-accounts-manage-location
:align: center
```

2. Find the account you want to manage. 

2. Select {ref}`Manage <#manage-button>` next to the account name.

```{lazyfigure} ../_static/solo_app/My_Accounts/my-accounts-manage-location.webp
:width: 50%
:name: my-accounts-manage-location
:align: center
```

3. Ensure that the {ref}`Account Being Managed <account-being-managed>` matches the account that you selected.

### Identifying the Current Account

Identify the current account you are using by looking for the account name next to your profile picture.

```{lazyfigure} ../_static/solo_app/My_Accounts/account-being-managed-location.webp
:width: 50%
:name: account-being-managed
:align: center
```

The account name is the name surrounded by parentheses (`()`). 

**It is:**

 - to the *right* of your login name.
 - to the *left* of your profile picture.
