## Primary and Mailing Addresses

The Profile section allows you to manage two types of addresses for your company:

1. **Primary Address** - Your company's main physical location
2. **Mailing Address** - Where correspondence should be sent (if different from primary)

## Editing Primary Address

Your company's primary address includes:

- Street Address
- City
- State/Province
- ZIP/Postal Code
- Country

To edit your company's primary address:

1. Navigate to the **Profile** section
2. Scroll to the **Primary Address** section
3. Click the **Edit** button
4. Update the address information as needed
5. Click **Save** to apply your changes

## Managing Mailing Address

If your company's mailing address differs from the primary address:

1. Navigate to the **Profile** section
2. Scroll to the **Mailing Address** section
3. Uncheck the **"Same as Primary Address"** box if it's checked
4. Enter the mailing address information
5. Click **Save** to apply your changes

If your mailing address is the same as your primary address, simply check the **"Same as Primary Address"** box.

## Address Validation

The system will validate your address to ensure:

- Required fields are completed
- ZIP/Postal code format is valid for the selected country
- Address formatting follows country-specific standards

If there are any validation errors, the system will display appropriate error messages.
