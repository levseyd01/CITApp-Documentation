With decades of financial industry experience, we've got answers to your questions.

**General**

**My Shareholder Account**

**Stock & Securities Queries**

**How many shares do I have?**
If you are a current shareholder of one of Transfer Online's issuing companies, you may log in to our online system to view current information about your holdings. Only shareholders of record have access to these features. If you hold your shares in street name, your broker will be able to provide you with information about your shares.

If you are an issuing company longing to know how many shares you have, you can view and download reports about all your stocks and shares in our online system - log in to your account now.

**How do I sell my stock?**
Transfer Online does not buy or sell shares. You can sell them through a brokerage account or a private transaction.

**How do I transfer shares to someone else?**
If you are a shareholder wishing to transfer your shares to someone else, you must inform Transfer Online of your intentions. This can be accomplished by completing and signing the back of the stock certificate, or if you do not possess a paper share certificate, by completing and signing a stock power form (which must be endorsed by all registered owners). All signatures must be guaranteed by a financial institution that is a member of the Medallion Stamp Program. Then, please forward all documentation to:

Transfer Online, Inc.
512 SE Salmon Street
Portland, OR 97214

**What is a medallion signature guarantee?**
A medallion signature guarantee is a program developed by the Securities Transfer Association to meet the requirements of a Securities and Exchange Commission rule, which broadened the number and type of financial institutions eligible to guarantee signatures. By medallion guaranteeing stock to be sold, assigned, and transferred, the guarantor assumes financial responsibility if the transfer is completed fraudulently.

**Where can I get a medallion stamp?**
A medallion signature guarantee may be obtained from a bank, brokerage firm, credit union, or savings and loan institution that is a member of the Medallion Stamp Program.

**Is this the same as a notary stamp?**
No. A notary stamp does not offer protection for the investor, the issuer, or the transfer agent against fraud. The notary stamp is not an acceptable form of signature guarantee.

**How can I find out if an old stock certificate has value?**
An old stock certificate may still be valuable even if the stock no longer trades under the name printed on the certificate. The company may have merged with another company or simply changed its name. In the first instance, contact the issuing company to see if they have any details on file. If the shares are trading, visit www.OTCmarkets.com to view past trading information. Note that even if a certificate has no monetary value, it may still be of value as a collectible.

**What is Transfer on Death registration?**
Transfer on Death (TOD) registration allows you to pass the securities you own directly to another person or entity (your "TOD beneficiary") upon your death without going through probate. When you register ownership of your shares, either with a stockbroker or the company itself, you request ownership in what's called "beneficiary form." The issued papers will also show the name of your beneficiary. By setting up your account or having your securities registered in this way, the executor or administrator of your estate will not need to take any action to ensure that your securities transfer to whoever you have designated. However, TOD beneficiaries must take steps to re-register the securities in their names after the death of the shareholder. This involves sending a copy of the death certificate and an application for re-registration to Transfer Online. The Transmittal/Stock Power form available in our Useful Documents can be used for this purpose.

Stock & Securities Queries
What are restricted and control securities?
Restricted securities are acquired in unregistered, private sales from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer. Investors often receive restricted securities through private placement offerings, Regulation D offerings, employee stock benefit plans, as compensation for professional services, or in exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to the company. Rule 144(a)(3) specifies what sales produce restricted securities.

Affiliate control securities are held by an affiliate of the issuing company. An affiliate is defined as a person, such as a director or large shareholder, who is in a control relationship with the issuer, meaning they have the power to direct the management and policies of the company, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. Acquiring securities from a controlling person or "affiliate" results in affiliate control securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's hands. If the shares were otherwise registered and not restricted by Rule 144, the affiliate control restriction becomes eligible for removal after a 90-day period.

Acquiring restricted securities typically results in receiving a certificate stamped with a "restricted" legend, indicating that the securities cannot be resold in the marketplace unless they are registered with the SEC or are exempt from registration requirements. “Affiliate Control” will be designated on the face of affiliate control certificates, and a legend may or may not be printed on the back, depending on whether they are registered shares.

What is Rule 144?
Rule 144 permits the public resale of restricted and control securities if specific conditions are met, necessitating an exemption from the SEC's registration requirements for selling them in the marketplace.

Conditions of Rule 144 for Affiliate Control Shares:
There are several conditions under Rule 144 for the resale of restricted and affiliate control securities, which include:

- A holding period of at least six months for securities from an issuing company that files with the SEC and is current with filings, one year for a non-reporting company, with a legal opinion letter addressing the “Shell” status of the issuer.
- Adequate current financial and contact information about the issuer must be available before the sale.
- For affiliates, the number of equity securities sold in any three-month period cannot exceed the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold, or, if the class is listed on a stock exchange, the greater of 1% or the average reported weekly trading volume during the four weeks preceding the filing of a notice of sale on Form 144.
- Affiliate-controlled share sales must be executed as routine trading transactions with no more than normal commission for brokers.
- Affiliates must file a notice with the SEC on Form 144 if the sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period. The sale must occur within three months of filing the notice, and if the securities have not been sold, an amended notice must be filed.

Non-Affiliate Conditions under Rule 144:
Individuals not affiliated with the issuer who have held the restricted securities for at least one year can sell them without adhering to the conditions discussed above. However, if the securities were held for at least six months but less than one year and the issuer is subject to the Securities Act reporting requirements, the sales are permitted as long as the current public information condition is satisfied.

Legend Removal Process:
For lifting restrictions on shares, typically restricted for one year (e.g., as part of employee benefits or in exchange for start-up capital), a restriction removal request can be made when the certificate is submitted with appropriate documentation. This might entail the 144D Seller’s Representation Letter and RegS Seller’s Representation Letter, available for download on the Transfer Online website under Resources and Download Forms. It's recommended that shareholders contact Transfer Online to ensure correct document submission and to be informed of any transfer fees. Upon receipt and approval from the corporation, the restriction will be removed, and a new certificate will be issued.

Addressing Disputes on Legend Removal:
Should a dispute arise regarding the removal of a restricted legend, the SEC will not intervene as it's solely at the discretion of the Issuing Company. Disputes about the removal of legends are governed by state law.

**SEO Analysis and Recommendations:**

1. **Title Tags & Meta Descriptions**: Focus on crafting unique and descriptive title tags and meta descriptions for each page. For a section like this Glossary, consider a title tag such as "Understanding Financial Documents: Glossary | CompanyName" and a meta description that summarizes the important terms explained on the page. Make sure to integrate keywords relevant to the content, such as “Affidavit of Domicile,” “Affidavit of Loss,” and “Financial Documents Glossary.”

2. **Headings Structure**: It's crucial to implement a logical hierarchy for headings. For this glossary, ensure each term is marked with an H2 tag for better content organization and readability. This not only helps users navigate the content easier but also aids search engines in understanding the page’s structure.

3. **Keyword Optimization**: In addition to using specific terms like those mentioned in the glossary, consider the incorporation of broader keywords that potential visitors might use when searching for such information, such as “financial document explanations,” “stock certificate FAQs,” or “shareholder documentation guide.” Spread these keywords naturally throughout the content.

4. **Internal and External Linking**: Wherever relevant, link to other sections of your site that further explain particular terms or concepts mentioned in the glossary. For example, if you have a more detailed article or service page related to “Affidavit of Domicile,” link to it.

**SEO Analysis and Recommendations:**

1. **Title Tags & Meta Descriptions**: Focus on crafting unique and descriptive title tags and meta descriptions for each page. For a section like this Glossary, consider a title tag such as "Understanding Financial Documents: Glossary | CompanyName" and a meta description that summarizes the important terms explained on the page. Make sure to integrate keywords relevant to the content, such as “Affidavit of Domicile,” “Affidavit of Loss,” and “Financial Documents Glossary.”

2. **Headings Structure**: It's crucial to implement a logical hierarchy for headings. For this glossary, ensure each term is marked with an H2 tag for better content organization and readability.

For example, if you have a more detailed article or service page related to “Affidavit of Domicile,” link to it. Furthermore, linking to authoritative external sources can enhance credibility and provide additional value to your readers.

5. **Alt Tags for Images**: If you include images, charts, or infographics to explain terms further, ensure each has a descriptive alt tag incorporating relevant keywords. This boosts accessibility while also contributing to image SEO.

BEGINNING OF PROOFREAD SECTION: Joint Tenancy

**Joint Tenancy**
A form of registration, properly abbreviated as "JT TEN" on stock certificates, signifies that all parties named on the certificate share an undivided interest in the represented shares. In the event of one tenant's death, the surviving tenants inherit the entire value of the certificate. This arrangement is identical to Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship.

**Legal Transfer**
Securities requiring special documents for transfer involve scenarios such as estate settlements of deceased shareholders, trust accounts, or corporate holdings.

**Market Maker**
A "Market Maker" is a firm prepared to continuously buy and sell a specific stock at publicly quoted prices. Often discussed within the context of the Nasdaq or other Over-The-Counter (OTC) markets, Market Makers on an exchange (e.g., New York Stock Exchange) are known as "third Market Makers". Many OTC stocks are supported by multiple market-makers, who are required to handle transactions of at least 100 shares or more. Consequently, a substantial order from an investor might be executed by several market-makers at varying prices.

**Market Risk**
Refers to the potential for the stock market to decline ('bear market') instead of appreciating ('bull market'). The primary method to mitigate market risk is through long-term investing since bear markets are historically transient.

**Medallion Signature Guarantee**
A certification provided by financial institutions like commercial banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, etc., which are participants in programs like the Securities Transfer Association Medallion Program (STAMP), the NY Stock Exchange Program, or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program (SEMP, MSP). It's important to note that this guarantee is distinct from a notarization.

**Medallion Stamp Program**
Developed by the Securities Transfer Association in response to an SEC Rule, this program broadens the eligibility of financial institutions authorized to guarantee signatures. Guaranteeing a stock's sale, assignment, or transfer under this program, the institution assumes financial liability in cases of fraudulent transactions. Eligibility extends to commercial banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, or savings and loan institutions participating in the Medallion Stamp Program.

**Mutual Fund**
Managed by an Investment Company, this fund pools money from shareholders to invest in a diverse portfolio including stocks, bonds, options, commodities, and money market securities.

**NASDAQ**
Stands for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, a computerized system that offers price quotations for stocks traded over-the-counter.

**Notary Seal**
A certification by a Notary Public indicating that the document signatory has affirmed the truthfulness and accuracy of its content.

**OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)**
An electronic quotation system showcasing real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information for numerous Over-The-Counter securities not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or a national securities exchange. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. administers the OTCBB, despite it not being a part of The Nasdaq Stock Market. For inclusion on the OTCBB, firms must maintain current financial reports with the SEC or relevant banking/insurance regulators.

**Over-the-Counter (OTC)**
Describes the process of trading securities through a broker-dealer network as opposed to on a centralized exchange. OTC stocks are not listed on formal exchanges but are traded predominantly via NASDAQ.

**BEGINNING OF PROOFREAD SECTION Pink Sheets**

The "Pink Sheets," named after the color of paper they were historically printed on, represent daily listings of price quotes for companies that trade on the Over-the-Counter market (OTC market). "Market Makers," brokers committed to buying and selling the securities of OTC issuers, utilize the Pink Sheets to publish bid and ask prices. A company named Pink Sheets LLC, previously known as the National Quotation Bureau, publishes the Pink Sheets in both hard copy and electronic formats. Pink Sheets LLC is not registered with the SEC as a stock exchange, and its activities are not regulated by the SEC. With few exceptions for foreign issuers, the companies quoted on the Pink Sheets are usually very small and thinly traded. Many do not meet the minimum listing requirements for trading on national exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Furthermore, many of these companies do not file reports or audited financial statements with the SEC, making it challenging for investors to find reliable, unbiased information about companies quoted on the Pink Sheets. For these reasons, investments in companies quoted on the Pink Sheets are considered among the riskiest. Therefore, investors should exercise extreme caution before investing in companies quoted exclusively on the Pink Sheets.

**BEGINNING CHUNK:**

Shareholders Of Record
Shareholders whose names actually appear on the records of the corporation from which the shares are issued. See also Street Name.
Short Selling
While an investor's mindset is usually to buy a stock first and then sell it later, short selling actually is just the opposite; sell now and then buy it back later. The short seller borrows the shares from a securities firm with the anticipation that they will decline in value. If the investor is correct, the shares can be bought back at a lower price and the investor realizes a gain. However, if the shares are bought back at a higher price, a loss will be realized.
Short Squeeze
A short squeeze results when the price of the stock rises and investors who short-sold the stock rush to buy it to cover their short position. As the price of the stock increases, more short sellers feel driven to cover their positions.
Small Estate Affidavit
A notarized document that the heir completes. The form lists the names of all heirs and next of kin of the decedent and states that probate was not initiated for the decedent. It must also be noted in the affidavit that the estate does not exceed the small estate maximum for the state in which the person resided.
Stock Power
Form used to instruct the transfer of ownership of a security from the registered owner(s)s to a third party. Required to be completed in cases of registered book entry shares or where back of certificate is not used. All shareholder(s) signatures are required and it should also be Medallion Guaranteed.
Street Name
Ownership of shares which are held for the benefit of the shareholder in a brokerage account, and are not reflected in the shareholder's name on the records of the corporation. See also Shareholders of Record.

6. **Mobile Optimization**: Confirm that this section (and the entire site) renders well on mobile devices. This includes ensuring that the search form and alphabet list are easily accessible and usable on smaller screens.

**Recommendations for Further Improvements**:

- **Content Enhancement**: Consider offering brief highlights or success stories for some of the clients listed. This can provide tangible examples of your company's impact and expertise.
  
- **Interactive Elements**: Implementing a dynamic search function that instantly filters the list could enhance user experience significantly.
  
- **Social Proof**: Links to case studies or testimonials from the clients listed can further bolster credibility and showcase the breadth of your services and client satisfaction.
  
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor the page speed and performance, especially with any additional enhancements, to ensure a smooth user experience across all devices.

Focusing on these areas can significantly elevate the user experience and strengthen the SEO performance of your "Our Clients" section and the site as a whole.
