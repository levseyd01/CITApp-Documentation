:::{admonition} Question(s)
:class: caution, dropdown


- [] Should there be colons after each category? 
- [X] Should "Every 1 Share Issue $2.35" be worded differently? - just the ratio - grammatically incorrect

  - [] even if you ahve a partial share, you will still get one share as the dividend.

:::{admonition} Possible Bugs
:class: error, dropdown

- [] The column furthest to the right seems to be blank. Should it be?
- [] Column names also shift from the left to the right if I click them - is this intended?
- [] The entire table vanishes if I click on any of the column names more than twice. I get a "No matching records found" message. Is this intended?

:::{admonition} Error(s)
:class: danger, dropdown


- [] This section may not be done yet. There is a green button at the bottom right of the screen. I press it and nothing happens. 
  - [] Filtering a column causes the button to move up and down, from first row to last, etc. 
  - [] The button works sometimes. It's actually the "Update Cash Payment" button. 
- [] In either case, the green checkbox that appears after updating the cash payment has no words. 
- [] Also, after updating, the "Update Cash Payment" button vanishes. Is that supposed to happen?
