#### Proofread: FAQ - My Stocks and Shares

##### How many shares do I have?
If you are a current Shareholder of one of Transfer Online's Issuing Companies, you can log in to our online system to view up-to-date information about your holdings. This feature is exclusively available to Shareholders of Record. Should you hold your shares in street name, your broker will provide you with information about your shares.

For Issuing Companies wanting to know their share count, our online system allows you to view and download comprehensive reports about your stocks and shares. Log in to your account now.

##### How do I sell my stock?
Transfer Online does not buy or sell shares. You can sell your shares through a brokerage account or via a private transaction.

##### How do I transfer shares to someone else?
As a Shareholder wishing to transfer your shares, you must notify Transfer Online of your intentions. This can be done by completing and signing the back of the stock certificate. In the absence of a paper share certificate, complete and sign a stock power form, endorsed by all registered owners. All signatures need to be guaranteed by a financial institution participating in the Medallion Stamp Program. Following this, forward all documentation to:

Transfer Online, Inc.
512 SE Salmon Street
Portland, OR 97214

#####  What is a medallion signature guarantee?
A medallion signature guarantee is a certification from the Securities Transfer Association, fulfilling the requirements of a Securities and Exchange Commission rule. This rule extends the eligibility for financial institutions to guarantee signatures. The guarantor accepts financial responsibility in the event of fraudulent completion of the transfer of stock sold, assigned, or transferred.

#####  Where can I get a medallion stamp?
You can obtain a medallion signature guarantee from a bank, brokerage firm, credit union, or savings and loan institution enrolled in the Medallion Stamp Program.

#####  Is this the same as a notary stamp?
No. Unlike a notary stamp, a medallion stamp provides protection against fraud for the investor, the issuer, and the transfer agent. A notary stamp is not an acceptable form of signature guarantee.

#####  How can I find out if an old stock certificate has value?
An outdated stock certificate may retain its value, regardless of the company no longer trading under the name printed on the certificate. The company could have merged with another or undergone a name change. Initially, contact the Issuing Company for any details on record. If the shares are actively trading, explore www.OTCmarkets.com for historical trading information. Take note, a non-valuable certificate might still possess collectible worth.

#####  What is Transfer On Death registration?
Transfer on Death (TOD) registration allows the direct transfer of your securities to a designated person or entity ("TOD beneficiary") upon your death, bypassing probate. Registering your share ownership in "beneficiary form," either with the stockbroker or the company directly, incorporates your beneficiary's name on the ownership documents. This registration ensures the seamless transfer of your securities post-mortem without executor or administrator intervention. However, TOD beneficiaries are required to re-register the securities under their names, including submitting a death certificate and a re-registration application to Transfer Online. The Transmittal/Stock Power form, available in our Useful Documents, facilitates this process.

#### FAQs - Stocks and Securities Queries

FAQs
With decades of experience in the financial industry, we've got answers to your questions.

##### What are restricted and control securities?

Restricted securities are securities acquired in unregistered, private sales directly from the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer. Investors often receive restricted securities through private placement offerings, Regulation D offerings, employee stock benefit plans, compensation for professional services, or in exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to the company. Rule 144(a)(3) specifies the sales that produce restricted securities.

Affiliate control securities are those held by an affiliate of the issuing company. An affiliate is an individual, such as a director or large shareholder, who has a controlling relationship with the issuer. This means the shareholder has the power to influence the management and policies of the company, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. Purchasing securities from a controlling person or "affiliate" results in acquiring affiliate control securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's possession. Should the shares be otherwise registered and unrestricted by Rule 144, the affiliate control restriction will be eligible for removal after a 90-day period.

Upon acquiring restricted securities, recipients usually receive a certificate stamped with a "restricted" legend. This legend signifies that the securities cannot be sold in the marketplace unless they are registered with the SEC or exempt from registration requirements. Certificates for affiliate control securities are labeled “Affiliate Control” on the certificate's face and may have a legend on the back depending on their registration status.

##### What is Rule 144?

To sell restricted securities or control securities in the marketplace, an exemption from the SEC's registration requirements is necessary. Rule 144 permits the public resale of restricted and control securities under specific conditions.

##### What are the conditions of Rule 144 for affiliate control shares?

For the resale of restricted securities or affiliate control securities in the marketplace, Rule 144 mandates several conditions:

- Restricted securities must be held for a minimum of six months if the issuing company is SEC-compliant and up to date with filings. For a non-reporting company, the holding period extends to one year, requiring a legal opinion letter to address the issuer's “Shell” status.
- Adequate, current financial and contact information about the issuer must be available before the sale.
- Affiliates may sell no more than 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold during any three-month period or, for listed shares, the greater of 1% or the average reported weekly trading volume during the four weeks preceding the sale's notice on Form 144. Over-the-counter stocks, including those quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and Pink Sheets, adhere to the 1% rule.
- Affiliate-controlled share sales must occur as routine trading transactions with no more than the standard commission.
- Affiliates filing a notice with the SEC on Form 144 for sales exceeding 5,000 shares or $50,000 must conduct the sale within three months of filing; unsold securities require an amended notice.


##### If I am not an Affiliate of the Issuer, what conditions of Rule 144 must I comply with?

Non-affiliates, who have held on to their restricted securities for at least one year, can sell their shares without adhering to Rule 144's conditions discussed above. However, if the securities have been held for at least six months but less than one year and the issuer is under the Securities Act's reporting requirements, the sale must fulfill the current public information condition.

If the shares have been in possession for less than six months, Transfer Online™ will not remove the legend without the issuer's consent, typically provided through a legal opinion from the issuer's counsel.

Purchasing restricted securities from a non-affiliate allows the buyer to append the non-affiliate's holding period to their own. For gifts from an affiliate, the holding period commences when the affiliate initially acquired the securities, not on the gift date. For stock options, including employee stock options, the holding period begins when the option is exercised.

To initiate the legend removal process, contact the issuing company or Transfer Online™ for procedural guidance. Due to the complexities of transferring restricted securities and removing legends, seeking legal advice from a securities law specialist is recommended.

##### How do I lift restrictions?
Restricted shares, such as those acquired through employee benefits or in exchange for start-up capital, are typically restricted for one year. After this period, the shareholder can request restriction removal with appropriate documentation, including the 144D Seller’s Representation Letter and RegS Seller’s Representation Letter, available on Transfer Online™'s website. This process requires notification, supported documentation, and may incur transfer fees. Upon approval, the restriction is lifted, and a new certificate is issued.

Restriction removals are not permitted for shares from a “Shell” status company, as defined by the SEC, except for former “Shell” status companies that satisfy one-year reporting requirements.

##### What if a dispute arises over whether I can remove the Legend?
In cases of dispute regarding legend removal, the SEC does not intervene. Legend removal is determined by the issuing company, with state law governing any disputes.
