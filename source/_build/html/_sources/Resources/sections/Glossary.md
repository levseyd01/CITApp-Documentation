::::


Joint Tenancy
A form of registration, properly abbreviated as "JT TEN" on stock certificates, that means that all parties named on the certificate have an undivided interest in the shares represented by the certificate. Thus, if one of the tenants should die the entire value of the certificate becomes the property of the surviving tenants. (Identical to Joint Tenancy With Right of Survivorship.)

Legal Transfer
Transfer of securities which require special documents because they involve the settlement of estates of deceased shareholders, trust accounts, or corporation holdings.
Market Maker
A "Market Maker" is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell a particular stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. You'll most often hear about Market Makers in the context of the Nasdaq or other "Over The Counter" (OTC) markets. Market Makers that stand ready to buy and sell stocks listed on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, are called "third Market Makers." Many OTC stocks have more than one market-maker. Market-makers generally must be ready to buy and sell at least 100 shares of a stock they make a market in. As a result, a large order from an investor may have to be filled by a number of market-makers at potentially different prices.
Market Risk
The risk that the stock market will go down ('bear market') rather than up ('bull market'). The only certainty of reducing market risk lies in long-term investing, as bear markets always eventually end.
Medallion Signature Guarantee
A statement (stamp and signature) given by a financial institution such as a commercial bank, credit union, brokerage firm, etc., that are members of the Securities Transfer Association Medallion Program (STAMP), NY Stock Exchange Program or Stock Exchange Medallion Program (SEMP, MSP.) The Medallion Program is not a notarization.
Medallion Stamp Program
A program developed by the Securities Transfer Association to meet the requirements of an SEC Rule which increases the number and type of financial institutions eligible to guarantee signatures. By Medallion Guaranteeing the stock to be sold, assigned or transferred, the financial institution is taking financial responsibility if the transfer is completed fraudulently. A Medallion guarantee may be obtained from a commercial bank, brokerage firm, credit union or savings and loans institutions that are members of the Medallion Stamp Program.
Mutual Fund
A fund operated by an Investment Company that raises money from shareholders and invests it in stocks, bonds, options, commodities, or money market securities.


NASDAQ
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. This computerized system provides price quotations on securities traded over-the-counter.
Notary Seal
Provided by a Notary Public; a notary seal signifies that the party signing the document has sworn that contents of the document are truthful and accurate.


OTC Bulletin Board
The OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) is an electronic quotation system that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information for many Over-The-Counter securities that are not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or a national securities exchange. Brokers who subscribe to the system can use the OTCBB to look up prices or enter quotes for OTC securities. Although the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. oversees the OTCBB, the OTCBB is not part of The Nasdaq Stock Market. Under the OTCBB's eligibility rule, companies that want to have their securities quoted on the OTCBB must file current financial reports with the SEC or with their banking or insurance regulators.
Over-the-Counter
The buying and selling of securities through a nationwide network of brokers and dealers. 'OTC' stocks are not listed on an exchange but are sold primarily through NASDAQ.



**Joint Tenancy**
A form of registration, properly abbreviated as "JT TEN" on stock certificates, signifies that all named parties on the certificate share an undivided interest in the represented shares. Consequently, if one of the tenants passes away, the entire certificate value transfers to the surviving tenants. This arrangement is identical to Joint Tenancy With Right of Survivorship.

**Legal Transfer**
This involves the transfer of securities requiring special documents due to the settlement of estates of deceased shareholders, trust accounts, or corporation holdings.

**Market Maker**
A Market Maker is a firm ready to buy and sell a specific stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. Market Makers are commonly discussed in the context of the Nasdaq or other Over The Counter (OTC) markets. Those that operate on exchange platforms like the New York Stock Exchange are referred to as "Third Market Makers." Many OTC stocks are supported by multiple market-makers. Generally, market-makers are prepared to buy and sell a minimum of 100 shares of the stocks they manage. Consequently, large orders may need to be distributed among several market-makers, possibly at varying prices.

**Market Risk**
Market risk is the danger of the stock market taking a downturn ('bear market') instead of an upswing ('bull market'). Long-term investing is the only strategy with a certainty of mitigating market risk since bear markets invariably conclude.

**Medallion Signature Guarantee**
A Medallion Signature Guarantee consists of a stamp and signature provided by a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, credit union, brokerage firm, etc.) that is a member of the Securities Transfer Association Medallion Program (STAMP), NYSE Program, or Stock Exchange Medallion Program (SEMP, MSP). It is important to note that a Medallion Guarantee is not a notarization.

**Medallion Stamp Program**
The Medallion Stamp Program, developed by the Securities Transfer Association, caters to an SEC Rule's requisites, broadening the range and type of financial institutions endorsed to guarantee signatures. Guaranteeing the stock to be sold, assigned, or transferred via a Medallion stamp implies that the institution assumes financial liability should the transfer be fraudulent. Eligible institutions include commercial banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, or savings and loan institutions that are members of the Program.

**Mutual Fund**
A Mutual Fund is an investment pool managed by an Investment Company, aggregating money from shareholders to invest in stocks, bonds, options, commodities, or money market securities.

**NASDAQ**
The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) is a computerized system offering price quotations for securities traded over-the-counter.

Brokers subscribing to the system can access OTCBB for pricing or quote entry for OTC securities. The OTCBB is overseen by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. but is not part of The Nasdaq Stock Market. Companies aiming for their securities to be quoted on the OTCBB must comply with current financial report filing requirements with the SEC or their relevant banking or insurance regulators following the OTCBB's eligibility rule.

**Over-the-Counter (OTC)**
OTC refers to the process of buying and selling securities via a widespread network of brokers and dealers. OTC stocks are not listed on an exchange and are primarily sold through NASDAQ.

**Proxy Voting**

Proxy voting allows security holders to delegate their voting rights to the issuer’s attorney(s) in their absence during shareholder meetings. This can be achieved either through mailed paper proxy cards, where security holders indicate their vote and return the card to the transfer agent, or via online voting on a secure website hosted by a proxy voting service provider where security holders can log in and submit their votes.

**Short Selling**

While an investor's mindset is typically to buy stock first and then sell it later, short selling follows the opposite approach; selling now and then buying back later. The short seller borrows the shares from a securities firm, anticipating that their value will decline. If the investor's prediction is correct, the shares can be repurchased at a lower price, realizing a gain. However, buying back the shares at a higher price results in a loss.
